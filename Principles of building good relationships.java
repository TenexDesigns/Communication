Building and maintaining healthy friendships requires adherence to certain principles and rules. Here are some guidelines to help you make friends and live well with people:

1. **Prime Time**: Schedule time for your friendships. Don't leave friendships to "someday" or to the leftover bits of time between the things we sometimes deem more important, such as work or household to-dos [Source 1](https://www.unity.org/resources/articles/10-rules-healthy-friendships).

2. **Be Loyal**: Avoid gossip, negative commentary, or complaining about a friend behind their back. This can create rifts between you and your friend who is not there—and also complicate relationships with others who have heard or joined in this conversation [Source 1](https://www.unity.org/resources/articles/10-rules-healthy-friendships).

3. **Privacy and Sharing**: Be clear with your friend about what is appropriate to share—and what stays in the privacy of your friendship. Enjoy what has been shared within the intimacy of your relationship [Source 1](https://www.unity.org/resources/articles/10-rules-healthy-friendships).

4. **Open Up About Yourself**: Share something a little bit more personal than you would normally. This helps to build intimacy in the friendship [Source 3](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships-communication/making-good-friends.htm).

5. **Be a Good Listener**: Be prepared to listen to and support friends just as you want them to listen to and support you [Source 3](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships-communication/making-good-friends.htm).

6. **Give Your Friend Space**: Don't be too clingy or needy. Everyone needs space to be alone or spend time with other people as well [Source 3](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships-communication/making-good-friends.htm).

7. **Repair Small Issues**: Address issues while they’re small. This could mean apologizing or spending time talking about how you’ll both try harder in the future [Source 4](https://www.betterup.com/blog/10-tips-to-help-you-make-friends-and-get-along-better-with-others).

8. **Follow the Platinum Rule**: Treat others as they would want to be treated. When we get to know what’s important to other people and then treat them accordingly, we’re letting them know how much they mean to us and how important the relationship is [Source 4](https://www.betterup.com/blog/10-tips-to-help-you-make-friends-and-get-along-better-with-others).

9. **Show Interest in Others**: Ask (and really listen to what they say) about their interests, experiences, and the things that are important to them. Building familiarity leads to greater comfort and trust [Source 4](https://www.betterup.com/blog/10-tips-to-help-you-make-friends-and-get-along-better-with-others).

10. **Keep an Open Mind**: Listen with respect for other people’s perspectives and experiences. Look for opportunities to listen to them, even if you disagree with what they are saying [Source 4](https://www.betterup.com/blog/10-tips-to-help-you-make-friends-and-get-along-better-with-others).

Remember, these rules are not strict laws but guidelines to help you foster healthy and meaningful friendships.

  Here are some additional "school yard rules" that can evolve with you into adulthood to forge lasting friendships and live well with others:

**Respect:**

* **Treat everyone with kindness and consideration, regardless of their background or beliefs.** This might involve understanding different perspectives, practicing active listening, and avoiding judgmental language.
* **Respect personal boundaries and preferences.** Ask before borrowing things, offering physical contact, or sharing personal information.
* **Acknowledge and celebrate others' successes without jealousy or competition.** 

**Communication:**

* **Practice honest and open communication, but consider the impact of your words.** Speak your truth but avoid harsh words or hurtful criticism.
* **Be a good listener.** Pay attention to what people are saying, both verbally and nonverbally, and ask clarifying questions to show you're engaged.
* **Acknowledge mistakes and apologize if you hurt someone.** Taking responsibility shows maturity and strengthens bonds.

**Empathy and Support:**

* **Be a reliable friend who offers support in times of need.** Lend a listening ear, offer a helping hand, or simply be present for someone going through a tough time.
* **Celebrate life's joys with others.** Share in their accomplishments, big and small, and express genuine happiness for their successes.
* **Respect differences of opinion and avoid pushing your own agenda.** Remember, healthy relationships thrive on diverse perspectives and respectful discussion.

**Personal Growth:**

* **Be open to feedback and willing to learn and grow.** Take constructive criticism as an opportunity for improvement, not a personal attack.
* **Maintain your own interests and passions.** A healthy balance between your needs and those of others fosters stronger relationships.
* **Forgive yourself and others for past mistakes.** Holding onto grudges only weighs you down.

Remember, these are just some guiding principles. Building strong relationships requires constant effort, understanding, and a willingness to adjust as you navigate life's complexities. 

Here are some additional tips:

* **Be genuine and authentic.** People appreciate those who are true to themselves.
* **Have a sense of humor.** Laughter can bridge gaps and ease tension.
* **Be reliable and trustworthy.** Follow through on commitments and be someone people can depend on.
* **Don't be afraid to be vulnerable.** Sharing your experiences and emotions can deepen connections.

By taking these "school yard rules" to the next level, you can build meaningful friendships and create a fulfilling life surrounded by good people.
