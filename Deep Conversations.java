   - **Avoid:** Interrupting or waiting for your turn to speak without genuinely listening.

### **2. Avoid Interview Mode:**
   - **Tip:** Instead of asking too many questions in rapid succession, share your thoughts or experiences related to the topic.
   - **Avoid:** Turning the conversation into a formal interview with a series of questions.

### **3. Share Personal Information:**
   - **Tip:** Open up about yourself, share experiences, and express your thoughts. This encourages the other person to do the same.
   - **Avoid:** Being too guarded or withholding personal information.

### **4. Build Rapport:**

### **10. Experience More:**
   - **Tip:** Seek out new experiences, read diverse materials, and stay informed about current events to have a broader range of topics to discuss.
   - **Avoid:** Staying in a comfort zone and discussing the same topics repeatedly.

### **11. Be Present:**

   - **Avoid:** Checking your phone or appearing disinterested.

### **12. Charisma:**
   - **Tip:** Project positivity, confidence, and genuine interest. Smile, maintain eye contact, and use open body language.
   - **Avoid:** Coming across as arrogant, disengaged, or overly self-centered.
